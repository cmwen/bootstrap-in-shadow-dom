# bootstrap-in-shadow-dom

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use [shadow dom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to run multiple versions of bootstrap in a single page.

## Results

- CSS was encapsulated within shadow dom. See different version of buttons can be render on the page at the same time without conflicting each other.
- The modal that need to take over the whole screen is not work for some reason. TODO
